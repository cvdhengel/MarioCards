# <b>Introduction</b> 
	This manual contains information about the development of Mario Cards, a modified and online version of the original Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST). This manual includes background information as well as requirements. In addition, it includes information about the development of the task; design, implementation, and verification. 

# <b>Background Information</b> 
	Mario Cards is a modified and online version of the original Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), invented by D.A. Grant & E. Berg in 1948. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) was originally developed as a measure of flexible thinking and abstract reasoning in healthy adults (Grant & Berg, 1948). Later on, it was found that the test could also be used to measure executive functioning in neurologically impaired adults, suggesting that the WCST is particularly sensitive to brain dysfunction in the frontal lobes, suggesting that the WCST can be useful in examining deficits in executive functioning associated with brain damage, seizure disorder, attention deficits and learning disabilities (Heaton, 2003). Altogether, the WCST can be used to measure the participantsâ€™ abilities to form, maintain and shift cognitive sets. 
	Still today, the WCST is a common used test in neuropsychological testing to measure executive abilities in neurologically impaired adults. This is often done with the hands-on card version. However, a digital version is less susceptible to individual differences between testleaders in administration the test. Mario Cards is a modified version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task which can be administered digitally.
